//! The plain-text mirror of a live session recording (issue #187).
//!
//! Everything Oryxis records goes into the vault encrypted, and History
//! exports it afterwards. What this adds is the other half of the ask:
//! a file on disk that grows WHILE the session runs, for tailing from
//! another window and for handing to somebody who does not have the
//! vault.
//!
//! Two rules make it safe to offer at all. It is off by default and it
//! is NOT its own capture: the bytes come from the same flush that
//! feeds the vault, so a host set to never record produces no file
//! either, and the redaction that scrubs the stored chunk is the same
//! pass that reaches the disk. And what lands there is what a person
//! read, not the wire: the chunk goes through the linear ANSI renderer
//! (`ansi_render`, the transcript export's own pipeline), so a progress
//! bar is one line per flush rather than a thousand escape sequences.
//! Per flush, because each chunk is rendered on its own: a redraw that
//! reaches back into the previous chunk cannot, so a bar that repaints
//! in place for ten seconds lands as a handful of lines, not one.
