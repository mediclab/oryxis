//! Dropping a dragged tab into the displayed tab's pane grid: the app
//! side of the split anchors (issue #112). `crate::pane_drop` answers
//! *where*; this answers *whether* and *what happens*.
//!
//! The gesture reads as "pull this session in beside the one I'm looking
//! at", and it works out because iced's `button` publishes `on_press` on
//! the RELEASE (`button.rs`, `ButtonReleased`), not the press: grabbing a
//! chip therefore does not select it, so the content area keeps showing
//! the tab that was already active. That tab is the destination, the
//! grabbed one is the source, and the whole thing needs no
//! remember-and-restore of the selection.
