//! Reopen the last closed tab (issue #186): the capture side that every

//! one back.
//!
//! Closing a tab is one click on a small target sitting between two other
//! small targets, and the session behind it is not recoverable by
//! undoing anything else. The browsers' answer is a stack of recently
//! closed tabs, and it works here because the app already has a
//! serializable "how do I recreate this tab" value: the pin spec. So a
//! reopen is not a second restore mechanism, it is the pin's resolution
//! (`spec_open_message`) reached from a different door.
