# Issue #208 item 4, first gesture: rearranging a tab's grid by dragging
# a pane. Needs the per-pane header, because the grid refuses to start a
# drag on a pane with no title bar (`Content::can_be_dragged_at`), so the
# prologue here is `pane-header.ice`'s: turn the preference on through
# the settings search, then build a split of two local shells.
#
# The press must land in the header's PICK AREA, which is the gap
# BETWEEN the label and the controls; the label text and the two buttons
# are deliberately not grabbable. With a shrink-width label on the left
# and shrink-width controls on the right, that gap is the middle of the
# strip: x=300 is inside it, y=54 is inside the 24 px header band.
#
# The move has to clear iced's own 10 px drag deadband (stricter than
# the tab strip's 6 px), hence the two `move` lines rather than one.
#
# What is asserted in TEXT is that the rearrange preserves: one pane is
# killed first, and its header still says so afterwards, which fails if
# the drop rebuilt or reset the pane instead of moving it. The resulting
# GEOMETRY (side by side becoming stacked) rides a screenshot, because
# the batch runner reports no coordinates for `find`, so there is no way
# to assert a pane's position in text.
#
# Unlike tab-drag-split.ice, the DROP here needs no screenshot to work.
# That one takes one because its drop hit-tests the app's own
# `Pane.bounds` cells, which only fill in when something draws; a drag
# that starts on a pane is hit-tested by the grid against its own layout
# tree, which the emulator has whether or not a frame was rendered.
#
# The two mid-gesture shots are about the PREVIEW rather than the drop.
# The highlight is the rectangle the pane lands in, which is not the
# region the cursor is over: dropping on a pane's edge closes the dragged
# pane first and the target grows into the gap, and a grid edge re-splits
# the root rather than the band being hovered. On this 1200 wide grid
# both shots should therefore show a HALF, x=600 w=600 over the right
# pane's right third and x=0 w=600 on the left rim, not the ~300 wide
# third and the ~27 wide band the cursor is actually inside.
