# Issue #208 item 4, the two gestures that take a pane OUT of its grid:
# dragged by its header onto another tab's chip, and broken out into a
# tab of its own by each of its four doors (tab menu, header menu, the
# chord, the header button). Same prologue as pane-drag.ice: headers on
# through the settings search, then a split of two local shells.
#
# The pane that travels is KILLED first, so every landing can be told
# apart from a rebuild: a moved pane still carries its verdict, in its
# header when it lands in a split and as the end-of-session card when it
# lands alone.
#
# "Broadcast" is the status-bar segment a SPLIT tab shows and a lone one
# does not, so it doubles as "which tab is on screen": after the drop it
# proves the view followed the pane into the destination split (the chip
# under a release is a button, and a button does not fire on a release
# whose press began elsewhere, so the app has to select it), and after a
# break-out its absence proves the new lone tab is the one displayed.
#
# Coordinates: (300, 54) is the left pane's header pick area (between
# the label and the controls); (470, 20) the third chip while the second
# is displayed; (460, 20) that same chip once it is the active, wider
# one; (40, 54) the left header's NAME; (566, 54) the left header's
# break-out button, the middle of its three controls.
