# Issue #208 item 2: the optional per-pane title bar. Off by default and
# split-only, so this has to turn it on, build a split, and kill one
# pane. Two local shells, which is the only split a headless run can
# build without a host.
#
# The setting is reached through the settings SEARCH rather than by
# scrolling: the row sits ~2000 px down its section, out of a 750 px
# viewport, and the search reveal scrolls it to a fixed place at the top.
# That is also what pins the one coordinate here. Clicking the LABEL does
# nothing (a `nav_toggle_row` puts the switch on the right), so the click
# has to land on the toggler. To re-measure after a layout change, take a
# screenshot right after the `type enter` below and read the switch off
# it; `find` reports content coordinates, not viewport ones, so it cannot
# answer this.
