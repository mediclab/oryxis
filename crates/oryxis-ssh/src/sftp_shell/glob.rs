//!
//! Written by hand rather than pulled from `globset`, which is excellent
//! and wrong for this: it exists to walk a filesystem, and everything
//! here matches against names a `list_dir` already returned. The whole
//! job is `*`, `?` and `[...]` over one path component, which is 60 lines
//! and no new dependency.
//!
//! It follows `sftp(1)`, which follows the shell: `*` does NOT cross a
//! `/`, so `old/*.gz` expands inside `old` and never further down. That
//! is why matching is per COMPONENT ([`split_components`]) rather than one
//! pattern run over the whole string.

/// output of this feeds `rm`, and a caller that forgets to split would
/// otherwise turn `rm *` into a pattern that reaches down the tree. A
/// safety property that costs one comparison should not depend on every
/// call site remembering it.

/// A leading dot IS special, the way it is in the shell and therefore in
